         <h4>1679</h4>
         <p>The concept of coding is originated from a German mathematician whose name was Gottfried Leibniz.
		 He is famed for the recognition of a system which is based on two digits: 0 and 1, also known as binary. 
		 His inspiration was to make a mechanical calculator which would calculate automatically based on the
		 amount of marbles that falls through an open hole and the amount that remains at a closed hole. The open
		 and close holes resembled true and false as does 1 and 0 in modern coding. The calculated was never built,
		 but Leibniz’s ideas were of importance and thus making him the first of many individuals who utilized binary
		 to solve problems.</p>

         <h5>More on Gottfried Leibniz</h5>
         <p>Gottfried Leibniz was born in 1646 and died in 1716. He was an engineer, a mathematician, a physicist, and a logician. 
		 Throughout his duties as an official historian and a legal advisor, he traveled in many countries in Europe and met numerous
		 intellectual mathematicians and physicists whom he had shared ideas with. He worked and engineered a variety of calculating machines,
		 clocks, and even mining machinery. Leibniz was an obvious polymath of broad mathematics, and as a result he had made brilliant discoveries
		 which had impacted the modern world. Some of his most famed groundbreaking discoveries include topology, the integral & differential calculus
		 (Also recognized by Isaac Newton a few years later), and the binary system which he had perfected in 1679.</p>

         <h4>1804</h4>
         <p>After more than a century, the concept of binary was used by a French weaver named Joseph Jacquard. His invention:
           an automated steam-powered weaving loom, consisted of cardboards which were used as the template to poke holes through. 
           The absence or appearance of holes poked through the cardboard ultimately determined a certain pattern that the loom weaves. 
           Although Jacquard’s invention is not much compared to contemporary machines, it made manual looming labor much more relaxing in France.
           Jacquard also sold many of his machines including the cardboards for extra profit. He died a quiet and comfortable death in 1834.</p>

         <h5>More on Joseph Jacquard</h5>
         <p>Jacquard was born in Lyon, France in 1752. His father died in 1772 and left Jacquard his family house and a hand loom which
		 he had ran in a silk factory. Jacquard had served in the French Army when he was 38 and after that he had built his automated
		 steam-powered weaving loom, which he had demonstrated in Paris and won himself a patent and a medal. In 1806 his invention was
		 public and he was given pension and a royal payment for each machine created. His invention was crucial to the advancement of
		 Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which in essence might have affected the overall technological development of the human race.</p>

         <h4>1842-1843</h4>
         <p>Jacquard’s idea was later improved by British mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage thought of a machine that would take
		 in binary information and turn them into instructions. It was named the ‘Analytical Engine’. Although Babbage was uncertain
		 of how to design the machine, fellow Mathematician Ada Lovelace who was also fluent in the study of binary was able to thoroughly
		 explain how Babbage’s machinery could have worked. However, the machine was never built.</p>

         <h5>More on Charles Babbage</h5>
         <p>Charles Babbage was a mathematician famed for his inventions and ideas. His Difference Engine No.1 was the first successful
		 automatic calculator ever made and he is sometimes referred to as the ‘father of computing’, thus being recognized by his brilliant
		 idea of turning binary information into instructions.</p>

         <h5>More on Ada Lovelace</h5>
         <p>Lovelace was born 1815 the daughter of well-known poet, Lord Byron. Her thorough understanding in mathematics had granted her
		 the chance of meeting Mary Somerville, an astonishing mathematician who was able to translate Laplace’s work into English, and whose
		 texts were used in Cambridge. As a result to their encounter, Lovelace was able to discover Babbage’s proposal for the Analytical Engine,
		 which at the time only a few people were interested in the universality of Babbage’s ideas.</p>

         <h4>1890</h4>
         <p>Herman Hollerith of the US census adapted both Jacquard and Babbage’s technologies, and with the newly discovered usage of electricity,
		 he was able to make cards consisting of each person’s census data. The astonishing process took him approximately eight years to manually
		 record every U.S citizen’s data. He then later turned his invention into a business, which is now known as IBM.</p>

         <h5>More on Herman Hollerith</h5>
         <p>Herman Hollerith was born in 1860 and died in 1929. He was a US census who worked as a statistician for the Census Office in his twenties.
		 During his early work experiences, he and his mentor John Shaw Billings both agreed that the Census Office needed an easier way to collect
		 and store data. Impressed by Jacquard’s automatic looming machine, he created his own invention: the ‘electric tabulating machine’, which was
		 able to provide more statics in a lower amount of time. After foreign countries such as Canada, Norway, and Austria were desperate to seize
		 Hollerith’s technology, Hollerith formed the ‘Tabulating Machine Company’, knowing his revolutionary invention should be kept to a minimum of
		 usage. His company was later renamed as ‘International Business Machines Corporation’, also known as IBM.</p>

         <h4>1923</h4>
         <p>At the end of WWI, a German engineer named Arthur Scherbius created the Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was able to encode and decode
		 messages and was used as a message transmitter by Nazi Germany in WWII. It was later declared commercially available, which was a big mistake
		 by the Germans as it made it easier for British mathematician Alan Turing to decode German messages, which was said to shorten the war by
		 approximately two years. This was the first time coding has been used as a weapon-like feature for war.</p>

		<div class="timeline-content">
         <h4>1936</h4>
         <p>Scherbius’ Enigma machine was designed for only one task; its purpose was to send hidden messages which could be converted by ally military
		 forces. After Alan Turing cracked the code, he planned to construct his own more flexible version of the machine which would follows multiple
		 instructions on a long piece of memory tape.</p>

		<div class="timeline-content">
         <h5>More on Alan Turing</h5>
         <p>Born in 2 Warrington Crescent, London, Alan Turing has dedicated his entire life on computer science and cognitive science. He graduated
		 Sherborne School and studied mathematics in King’s College, Cambridge. He invented abstract computing machines, now renamed Turing’s Machines,
		 when he was 22. He strongly believed that his invention was capable of solving any correct mathematical method, and stands by his statement
		 when mathematician David Hilbert challenged his claim. Turing and Austrian logician Kurt Godel later crushed Hilbert after they proved that
		 Hilbert’s ideal was impossible to satisfy. As Germany grew hostile and threatened Great Britain, Alan was recruited to the headquarters of
		 the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, where he did good by decoding enemy messages. Shortly after,
		 he was invited to work in the National Physical Laboratory, where he built more computers and studied artificial intelligence and more. At an
		 age of 42, he died in 1954 due to Cyanide poisoning.</p>

         <h4>1948</h4>
         <p>Turing wasn’t able to complete his project due to the fact that it is impossible of building a memory of instructions out of paper tape.
		 However, engineers at Manchester University worked out a way to store memory with the use of electric charges. Combined with Turing’s ideas,
		 they built the first multi-purpose computer. The computer was named ‘Baby’ and contained 128 bytes of memory.</p>

         <p>Improvements were made on ‘Baby’ and it was soon sold commercially as Ferranti Mark 1. BBC had captured the earliest known recording of
		 digital music played by the computer, the few songs it played included God Save the King, Baa Baa Black Sheep, and In the Mood. British computer
		 scientist Christopher Strachey, a friend of Alan Turing, had coded the music program. This was the first case which coding had been used as 
		 entertainment.</p>

         <h4>1961</h4>
         <p>Three programmers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were the creators of the well-known video game Spacewar. They designed
		 and experimented the video game with the use of PDP-1--a fairly small computer at the time but still the size of two refrigerators. Spacewar
		 was based on two players who controls their own separate spaceship, and their goal is to destroy the other person’s spaceship without dying first.
		 The game’s concept promoted many other games that exists now such as first-person shooter games and real-time action.</p>

         <p>Smaller and more efficient computers were made to specialize in certain instructions. For example, The Apollo Guidance Computer System was
		 designed for the Nasa Apollo space programme. The computer was considered usable in 1966, and within three years of complex testing and improving
		 it took a major role in helping Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin reach the surface of the Moon. It had only 74KB of memory and was able to control a
		 13,000kg spaceship, orbiting at 3,500km/h around the Moon, and landing it safely back to Earth.</p>
