			<h2>Coding's importance in regards to today's education</h2>
		<div class="hydrogen">
			<p>HackerRank is a competitive website where programmers of all ages gather and compete in a variety of coding challenges, 
			‘hackers’ who are registered on the website are graded by their abilities to program, and their scores are collected as it 
			is what determines their rankings.</p>
			<p>In a HackerRank study in 2016, all of HackerRank’s ranking data were distributed based on programmers’ countries and
			conclusions were made based on the statistics of the 50 most developed nations. Within them, the U.S scored 28th,
			as an inferior of the 50 with a total score of 78% while providing the most competitors along with India who scored 76% and 
			ranked 31st. Facts like these often confuses people, HackerRank author Ritika Trikha even admitted “Many would assume...United
			States” will be leading, as it “...is the home of programming luminaries such as Bill Gates, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and
			Donald Knuth.” Also worth noting, countries that are not famed for famous programmers but rather their education as a whole such
			as Poland, Switzerland and Japan, scored big time on the rankings. Poland is 3rd with 98%, Switzerland is 4th with 97.9%,
			and Japan is 6th with 92.1%.</p>
			<p>Both datas from HackerRank and PewResearch had a congruent correspondence, which stated that countries with higher programming
			scores generally have superior grades in the 2015 International Student Assessment Program. A possible explanation for this
			correlation can be that programming enables students to gain “better performance in other academic areas”. This theory
			is non-controversial in the educational community and is concordant throughout decades. The World Bank’s Senior Education & Technology
			Policy Specialist Michael Trucano writes in agreement on Wise Ed Review, elaborating the fact that coding “can help develop important
			logical thinking and problem-solving skills”.</p>
			<p>Having recognized the increasing importance of coding skills, Estonia and the U.K addressed in 2014 that coding was added as a part
			of their national education curriculum. One year later, Australia also contributed to the movement.
			12 million dollars were funded by the Australian government to strengthen their STEM program and to support an introduction of
			computer coding across different year levels. This had led to the questioning of non-believers who disagreed on the utility of 
			learning coding, their ultimate question: were the contributions really necessary?</p>
			<p>The answer varies. While it could be argued that logical thinking and problem-solving skills could be mastered with math, science,
			and other major curriculums alone, the subject coding itself supplies unique opportunities that are unavailable in other classes. Its
			ability to familiarize pupils with IT jobs is exceptionally important in the 21st century. The head of the Media Arts and Sciences academic
			program Mitch Resnick supported his belief that coding encourages students to think critically and creativity in his TED talk “Let’s
			teach kids to code”. In his presentation, he talked about how students often forget things teachers taught them in school because
			the given content had no use in real life. Resnick provided a nonfictional scenario where a boy who failed to code a scoring system because
			he didn’t know the necessary codes.. The boy needed to use the ‘variable’ code, but even when he recognized the word from school, he but
			didn’t recall the meaning of the word because he never really used it in a life real situation. Resnick’s speech explained that when students
			are advanced enough to code their own programs, they will not only try and eventually succeed, but they will learn others skills that will
			benefit them in the future.</p>
			<p>Mitch Resnick also proposed an analogy in which reading is compared to coding. This analogy directly ties to my first point
			which stated that coding develops ”better performance in other academic areas”. He elaborated to audiences that “when you learn
			to read… it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.” He then explains
			that coding works the exact same way: “If you learn to code, you can code to learn”. Coding not only develops logical thinking and problem-solving
			skills, it's a helping-hand, an opportunity, and a must have skill that’ll benefit many dramatically in today’s technologically advanced society.</p>
