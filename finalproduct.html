      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>My name is Leo. I am a sophomore at ISB (International School of Beaverton).<br/>
	  This website is the final product of my MYP Personal Project class.<br/>
	  Please explore my website by using the navigation menu above after you've read the short paragraph below.<br/>
	  Thank you for your time.</p>
      <h3>What is my goal?</h3>
	    <div class="bronze"> 
      <p>As technology advances, much of the older generations fail to understand the complications of complex 
	  technology while younger generations are not yet attracted to the learning of computer science. I believe that our current generation
	  is responsible for learning the essentials of coding, as it is the fundamental of all software related computer science, which is largely depended in the new technical era.
	  My personal project's research topic is on coding and why it is important. The goal of my project is to learn as much about coding as I can and share the research information with my peers.</p>
